# barcode_scanner
I've built a versatile barcode scanner using OpenCV, imutils, videostream, and pyzbar libraries. The scanner supports both image-based and real-time video-based QR code scanning, delivering instant results. Decoded information is logged into a CSV file for easy access and organization. Check the README for technical details and usage instructions.
